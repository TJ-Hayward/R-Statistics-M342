# R-Statistics-M342
**This is my University Statistics Methods In Health Research & Social Science (M342)**  
The Labs are a fill in the gaps style so the content is a mixture of my own code with materials and code written by my lecturer.  
My coursework is all my own work.  
Shout out to Marianna who offered to by me chocolate if I get 100% in the coursework, I hope I win this bet.  
I would love to pass the module off the back of just being able to code and not actually knowing any statistics ðŸ« .  
Also I am using Jupiter notebooks in VSCode and it works on hopes and dreams so **GOOD LUCK** if you want it to work locally!
